This project is a responsive and user-friendly currency converter application built with React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com). Key features include:

- **Real-Time Currency Conversion**: Convert between over 160 currencies with up-to-date exchange rates.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.
- **Rate Alerts**: Set alerts for specific exchange rates and get notified when the target rate is reached.
- **Historical Exchange Rates**: View historical exchange rates for selected date ranges.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is visually appealing and functional across all devices.

This project demonstrates effective use of React hooks for state management, API integration, and responsive design principles to create a seamless user experience.
